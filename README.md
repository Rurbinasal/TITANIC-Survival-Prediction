"# Titanic-Survival-Prediction" 

# Description
The famous Titanic dataset most probably does not need much introduction. Please refer to [Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) for further background.

The aim of this brief and quick-and-dirty analysis was:
- To apply a full data science lifecycle in minimal time (one day) and see how much can be achieved by doing so
- To get a first feeling for how Kaggle competitions work, in order to tackle more complex projects in the future

# Findings:
- As with the description, the Titanic dataset and its findings are very well-documented and need not be repeated
- One interesting finding was applying CatBoost, which - similar to the more extensive Airbnb project - again yielded very good results, in the range of XGBoost, at less tuning and computation and hence provides an interesting alternative for the future
